# Text-Genreation-with-DM-and-MLM
The repository contains the code for our paper ["Improving Text Generation with Dynamic Masking and Recovering"](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/534) in IJCAI-2021

## Requirements
For NMT and AMR-to-Text generation:

* Python version = 3.6.10
* Pytorch version = 1.1.0

For Image Caption: 
* Python version = 2.7.16
* Pytorch version = 1.1.0

## Datasets

Because the amount of data pre-processed data is very large, for AMR-to-Text generation and Image Caption tasks, we give repositories to the data processing that we use.
* [WMT14EN-DE]()
* [IWSLT14DE-EN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hotynRPVR1anNdjuThOOLF6gg_B1yWLX/view?usp=sharing)
* [AMR-to-Text](https://github.com/Amazing-J/structural-transformer)
* [Image Caption](https://github.com/ruotianluo/ImageCaptioning.pytorch)


## Run code

For nmt, first, go into the **bert-dynamic-denoise** directory.


For AMR-to-Text, go into the **bert-dynamic-self** directory.
